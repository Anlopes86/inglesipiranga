                correct: 2,
                explanation: "For 'she' (third person singular), we use 'has' + past participle."
            },

                question: "Which question is correct?",

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "The correct structure for questions with 'ever' is: Have/Has + subject + ever + past participle."

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "We need the past participle of 'forget', which is 'forgotten'. The action of forgetting has a result in the present (I can't log in)."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "'Yet' is used in negative sentences and questions in the Present Perfect. For 'students' (they), we use 'haven't'."

                correct: 3,

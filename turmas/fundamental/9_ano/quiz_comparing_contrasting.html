                correct: 2,
                explanation: "'While' is a conjunction used to contrast two different ideas or facts. For example: 'I like coffee, while my brother prefers tea.'"

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "'Unlike' is used to show a clear contrast between two nouns. It means 'different from'."

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "'Similarly' is an adverb used to show that two ideas or facts are alike. It connects two sentences."
            },
            {
                question: "Choose the best option: '_____ methods require courage from the activists.'",

                question: "Complete the sentence: 'Peaceful protests can get a lot of public support. _____, disruptive actions can alienate potential allies.'",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The words 'similar', 'alike', and 'comparable' all indicate similarity. 'Different' is the word for contrasting, so it doesn't fit the pattern."
